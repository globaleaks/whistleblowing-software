This file is not used as template by the application and discarded using build.
The only aim of the file is:
 1) to push strings that can't be puished in an other ways
 2) to anticipate translations on transifex in case translations need to be pushed
 3) to prevent losing translations in case some strings are under removal

<span data-translate>Created</span>
<span data-translate>Expires</span>
