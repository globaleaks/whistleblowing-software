# GlobaLeaks

GlobaLeaks is a project aimed at creating a whistleblowing platform built on
FLOSS.

This is the main repository that serves to keep track of the overall
development of the GlobaLeaks platform as a whole.

To learn how to setup your own GlobaLeaks platform, look at [Globaleaks Wiki
documentation] (https://github.com/globaleaks/GlobaLeaks/wiki).
