GlobaLeaks is a project aimed at creating a whistleblowing platform built on
FLOSS.

This is the main repository that serves to keep track of the overall
development of the GlobaLeaks platform as a whole.

To learn how to setup your own GlobaLeaks, look at [Globaleaks Wiki
documentation] (https://github.com/globaleaks/GlobaLeaks/wiki)

Here we collect all the knowledge that is not specific to the client or backend
component.

## GlobaLeaks 0.2

This is a full rewrite and it collects all of the experience and knowledge
gained in building [GlobaLeaks
0.1](https://github.com/globaleaks/GlobaLeaks-0.1).


The main components of GlobaLeaks 0.2 are
[GLClient](https://github.com/globaleaks/GLClient) and
[GLBackend](https://github.com/globaleaks/GLBackend).

[GLClient](https://github.com/globaleaks/GLClient) is a javascript web
application that communicates to the
[GLBackend](https://github.com/globaleaks/GLBackend), the backend component of
GlobaLeaks.
