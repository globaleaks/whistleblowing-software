The following is the data format of a field entry used in handler I/O:

```
{
  "id": 
      this is the id of the field generated by the backend
  "label": LOCALIZED_DICT,
  "description": LOCALIZED_DICT,
  "hint": LOCALIZED_DICT,
  "multi_entry": true|false,
  "x":
      defines the x axis positioning of the field
  "y":
      defines the y axis positioning of the field
  "required": bool
      defines if the field answer is required
  "preview": bool
      defines if the field has to be shown in tips preview
  "stats_enabled": bool
     defines if the field is subject to stats
  "type":
      can be any one of the following:

       * inputbox
       * textarea
       * selectbox
       * radiobutton
       * checkbox
       * multiselect
       * modal
       * dialog
       * tos
       * fieldgroup

  "options":
      a dict specifying the options to be passed to the field.
      In the case of input_box, text_area, this is an empty dict.

      For input_box the format is:
          {
            "regexp": unicode
                a regular expression that the field should match
          }

      For radio, checkbox the format is:
          {
            VALUE[0]: {
              "text": LOCALIZED_DICT[0],
              "trigger": ID_OF_FIELD
            }
            VALUE[1]: {
              "text": LOCALIZED_DICT[1],
              "trigger": null
            }
          }

      For modal the format is:
          {
            "title": LOCALIZED_DICT,
            "body": LOCALIZED_DICT,
            "link": LINK
          }

      For the dialog the format is:

          {
            "title": LOCALIZED_DICT,
            "body": LOCALIZED_DICT
          }

      For the tos the format is:
          
          {
            "body": LOCALIZED_DICT
          }

      For the group the format is:

          {
            "fields":
                contains a list of fields in the format that is defined above
          }

      For the text the format is:

          {
            "min":
                number of minimum character size of the input
            "max":
                number of maximum character size of the input

            In both case, 0 means 'no requirements'

          (note: there are an hardcoded limit of IDONTREMEMBER byte on the DB)
          }

}
```

The format of the step data format is as follows:

```
{
  "name": LOCALIZED_DICT,
  "fields": 
      list of fields id
}
```

What will be returned by the `/fields` API is a list of fields.
What will be returned by the `/context/id` API is the list of steps.
